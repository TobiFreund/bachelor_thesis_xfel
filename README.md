# Data Analysis for a transient scattering experiment at an XFEL

This is the Code to my bachelors thesis "Data Analysis for a transient scattering experiment at an XFEL".

The file reflectivity_parrat.py shows the whole code from which excerpts can be found in tghe thesis.

hrixs_data.py has been used to prepare the data from the detector and generate the images.
How to get the data and an idea for a modular fitting approach can be found in the notebooks thesis_data.ipynb and thesis_fitting.ipynb respectively.
